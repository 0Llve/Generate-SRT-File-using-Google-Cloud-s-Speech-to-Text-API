1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
Mr. Evans, is it true that you were living with?

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,700
Mr. Ross in and around the time he

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,700
claims to have attended Harvard. Yes. We

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,500
shared an apartment at 5307

5
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,700
Huntington Boulevard in Brooklyn and how

6
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,900
exactly did he pay his rent you worked as

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,800
a bike messenger and made money on the side

8
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,800
taking the LSAT score people. Oh

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,900
wait, I'm confused. Why

10
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,900
would he have to resort to that if he

11
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,800
were a college graduate because he wasn't a college

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,200
graduate what

13
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,900
you mean? He never graduated from college. No,

14
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,700
he was kicked out of college for cheating on a

15
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:30,500
test.

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,800
Isn't it possible that

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,900
while he was living with you? He went back

18
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,500
to school and completed his

19
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,800
degree. Well, I don't see how

20
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,900
since most of his spare time spent sitting around

21
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,800
smoking weed with me. Let me get this

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,900
straight before he was

23
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,900
employed at Pearson Specter and

24
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,700
to the best of your knowledge. He

25
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,900
worked as a bike messenger and a

26
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,300
part-time LSAT

27
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,100
imposter. Yes

28
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,800
one last question. Mr.

29
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,700
Evans is it at all possible that Mike

30
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,700
Ross ever attended

31
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,100
Harvard Law School?

32
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,400
Now unless they had a satellite campus at

33
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,800
5307 Huntington Boulevard in Brooklyn.

34
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,800
No more questions your honor given that you

35
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,800
smoked all this Pub. Mr. Evans, isn't it

36
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,700
possible that if Mike Ross commuted

37
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,800
one day a week to Harvard law that you might

38
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,600
not remember that I'd remember.

39
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,900
Yeah, maybe it would but you'd lie through your teeth a

40
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,800
better at anyway wouldn't your objection?

41
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,300
Mr. Evans? Isn't it? True that you're a

42
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,900
longtime drug dealer and your testimony today

43
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,900
is only happening because you signed a

44
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,500
deal with Miss Gibson.

45
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,900
Giving you immunity doesn't mean I'm lying because you

46
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,700
wouldn't lie just to get out of going to prison.

47
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,800
No, I would not well. How about if the other reason was to

48
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,900
get back at someone you've been jealous of your entire

49
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,900
life. I've never been jealous of Mike Ross

50
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,900
in my entire life and I just caught you in a

51
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,700
lie objection your honor. Mr.

52
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,600
Evans. My next move is going to be to call

53
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,900
Jenny Griffith to the stand and she's going to

54
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,900
testify that you lied to her for

55
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,900
years about dealing

56
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,600
when she found out about it. She left you for Mike

57
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,800
Ross Jackson Badger is also going to

58
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,400
say that you were jealous of his mind.

59
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,900
And your entire life and when

60
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,900
you found out that she left you for

61
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,700
him. You were as jealous as a

62
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,900
human being can be now. Is that true or not

63
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,700
your honor. Let me rephrase is Miss Griffith going to be

64
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,600
perjuring herself or are you?

65
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,500
Yeah, it was Joseph.

66
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,900
And if he lied about all of that what's to make us believe that he

67
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,400
wasn't lying about everything else.
